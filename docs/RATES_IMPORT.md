# Importing exchange rates

- TBD

1. If needed import exchange rates
   - Rates should be available as `<HOME-DIR>/.fifo-calc/<currency>-<year>.rate..json`
   - See more details in the **_Import/provide exchange rates_** section below.

**Note:** Using Fifo-calc with currency pairs other than EUR/USD is not always straight forward and
may involve using a paid service. Basically you need the exchange rate for every transaction date
and that is not always freely available in a form that is easy to use (see
[Importing exchange rates](#importing-exchange-rates)).

Fifo-calc supports importing USD to EUR rates from the European Central Bank.
